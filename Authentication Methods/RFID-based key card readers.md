Can simulate keystrokes on a computer. This allows users to input text or commands by presenting the key card to a reader, essentially bypassing the traditional keyboard.


How it Works:
1. RFID Communication:**
    The key card contains an RFID tag, which communicates wirelessly with the reader. 
2. **Keystroke Simulation:**
    The reader interprets the data from the card and translates it into simulated keystrokes that the computer recognizes. 
3.  **Input to Computer:**
    These keystrokes are sent to the active window on the computer, just as if they were typed on a keyboard.

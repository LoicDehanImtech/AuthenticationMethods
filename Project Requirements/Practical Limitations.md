## Thin Clients
- Linux workstation
- Simply running a remote desktop session to the main windows server
- USB ports 'blocked' by IT (Potentially negotiable?)
	- Perhaps Whitelist certain type of devices
	- No power or data transfer

## Factory environment
1. Dust -> Sparks with repeated contact scanners (Cards, USB)
2. Gloves / Imperfect hands -> No Fingerprint / palm scan
